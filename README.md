Overview
This project is an interactive WebGL visualization that showcases dynamic visual effects using vertex and fragment shaders. The visualization responds to user input via mouse events and animates based on time. The primary focus is on modifying the fragment shader to create unique visual patterns.

Features
- Dynamic coloring and animation based on time
- Interactive response to mouse events
- Customizable fragment shader for creating unique visual effects

Project Structure
- vertexShader: Defines the positions of the vertices.
- fragmentShader: Contains the main logic for coloring and visual effects.
  
Usage
- Open index.html in a WebGL-supported browser.
- Interact with the canvas using your mouse to see the effects change.
- Modify the fragmentShader code to create your own visual effects.
